The presentation was definitely different than the first session...she didn't seem as "rushed" when speaking.  I liked that I got to hear the lecture BEFORE being asked or seeing any questions, therefore my focus was on listening/learning and not on answering the questions correctly.  I also liked that there were no percentages flashed on the screen of correct and incorrect answers, seeing that in the last video caused some anxiety and distracted from the learning experience. This one did not have that, and it made me feel that this video was centered on learning rather than answering questions.	No critique, I liked it.

I wish the quizzes had been placed at the end of segments.  It seemed silly that they weren't a conclusion, and there was additional important information shared after the quiz in most of the segments.   Also, quizzes weren't seamlessly integrated into the video-watching experience. I didn't like that I had to select the next section vs. clicking "next video."

I appreciate how wrong answers were handled with information leading to correct answers.    I also highly enjoyed the shortcut pop up which indicated I can pick up where I left off on video simply by pressing enter.	different colors across bottom of video were distracting, entirely too busy. This continued to distract me as the watched videos moved to the bottom of the page.   Also, I wish the video did not stop when submitting on screen quiz answers. I like the flow of video progressing until I choose to stop it.  Finally, when presented with a blue button to move onto the next video, it often only took me to a new segment not previously visible. I prefer a clear lay out of where I am going, and have been. I prefer buttons to be more precise, such as: move to next segment when that is the resulting action		This tool (the one I just used)	This tool (the one I just used)	On screen quiz questions helped me stay focused on the lesson, and served as a viewing guide that helped me pinpoint important facts and details

Although I chose to answer the quiz as and when they came, the possibility that they can be skipped for easy viewing was a plus point.  However, unlike previous chapter the explanations were not given in quiz and since this chapter has a lot more technical terms, it should have been there.  I liked that this chapter was visually captivating as well in term of study material.  Comparing the two methods of asking questions I liked this one better personally, because the questions didn't distract me. In the previous one I didn't want to cheat with knowing the questions beforehand without having seen the entire video.  Nonetheless I agree that for someone who has a last minute exam preparation to do, having the possible questions and material side by side can be more helpful. Like I said, it depends on personal preference.	I got extremely annoyed with the the snag in first video at 4:14, at first a I thought it is my net issue. But when it kept happening at the same time it really got me.  The video either got stuck at 4:14 or started again from section 1, unless I skipped the time manually.  Also, I am not happy with the subtitles, especially in this one. They have misspelled myelin as millin at some point and have done similar mistakes.  Please see to it that in subtitles there should be no spelling mistakes especially since it is an educational video.  At one point, an important information about myelin being post-mitotic was displayed behind professor's head. I almost missed it first time. Useful or additional information should be organized in one proper slide.  Also especially since this video introduced newer terms, a sort of recapitulation in the end or beginning of a new video or a slide could be put up to increase retention. 	This tool (the one I just used)	The previous one (the one I used in part 1)	This tool (the one I just used)	I understand the video needs accurate subtitles but when the professor is speaking, the subtitles should strive to achieve the essence of what she says, and not her "a-a-a" or her other half-words or stutterings.  Yes she is speaking impromptu and which is why the video tool seems engaging and simple. But the subtitles should avoid confusion by not including those parts, like in one place she changed her word mid-way which is totally acceptable in speech but not writing.

9/19/2014 23:44:41	annereynolds		quizcram	2	2			6	The second unit was harder	6	7	5	4	5	2	3	7	No streaming problems. I liked how once I was done, and I still had time in my 40 min, then I could go back to videos where I'd gotten questions wrong the first time on the quiz and review. I liked that sometimes, if I got the questions wrong, then the answers were switched around forcing me to read the answers again.  Also, having the questions from the beginning made me focus more on the answers to the questions than listening to the whole lesson material. I made a game with myself out of seeing when I thought I knew enough to answer the questions (without listening to the whole video). Then I'd listen to the whole video afterward. 	Make the intro to each video shorter if each video section is going to be as short as it is. I feel like I spent a lot of time listening to the intro music. But great work, overall!

You also don't see the question beforehand so you can't be waiting for the answers as in the other video tool which puts a greater emphasis on the content of the video as opposed to simply answering a question. I also like how it gives you a second chance when you got a question wrong instead of immediately giving you the answers as with the first one.  	The repetitive 12 second introduction got a bit annoying, but maybe that's because I'm really watching the clock now since I couldn't finish all the questions in the previous video tool...  A different issue that could be improved is the subtitles. Instead of having a direct transcription such as 'a, and' if she stutters, just have 'and' then I can focus on the content of the video more.

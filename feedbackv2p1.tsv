9/18/2014 5:23:44	angelicachavez		quizcram	4	5	5		3	4	7	2	5	4	7	6	The questions gave me an idea of what I should focus on during the lecture.The professor seemed to lecture a little too fast (perhaps it was just my perception) but I liked being able to replay it and answer any wrong answers. I also liked the review of previously missed questions.     The closed captioning and the red segment markers at the bottom of the screen somewhat obscured the drawings or other material on the screen.	The questions being displayed during the video were a little distracting.  I found myself looking over at the questions while the video was playing during which the professor quickly mentioned something important (part of the question) and I missed it.   I felt compelled to answer the questions correctly instead of watching the video to absorb the information. Perhaps only being able to preview the question before watching the video and then having access to answer it afterwards would help.   							
9/18/2014 5:38:21	nathanjones1		invideo	4	5	4		6	6	3	6	4	5	4	7	It looked well made and it was pleasant and user friendly.	I couldn't view in full screen.							
9/19/2014 0:26:53	sakshisundaram1		quizcram	3	2	6		6	6	7	7	7	7	7	7	The part where it starts explaining the CNS was visually captivating. The use of e-pen to mark the areas of brain were very helpful too.   Plus, I liked the way the professor was explaining the concepts. She didn't use heavy jargon and kept it simple.  I could review the things whenever I had doubts. The break up of video into smaller videos kept my interest alive. Had it been a one long video I would have been thoroughly confused and bored.	The answer in voluntary movements lists breathing as a voluntary movement too. I was not sure of that and wished more explanation could be found.   Since I remembered from my biology class days that our bodies has 3 types of muscles- voluntary, involuntary and cardiac.   So I was confused as to how breathing could be voluntary activity. Yes, we can regulate it but can we stop it altogether at our will?   Please include the breathing aspect in the video itself and not the questions. I spent majority of my time in getting that one question right. I got stuck on it.  The smaller videos sometimes end abruptly with half the information in previous and half in next. This causes the end part of the previous video to go unregistered and the continuity is disrupted. 				I really enjoyed the visual aspect of the videos. Could there be any way in which the first part could be made more engaging when the professor is speaking?  Like she can draw on whiteboard more or make bullet points where no visual aid is possible.

That is, it made me feel at ease to know what topic to expect next	On screen text was distracting when it provided misspoken sentences, I find captions helpful that contain the intended lecture, and leave out the inevitable but slight mistakes of public speaking 				Short lectures make it easier to attain and refer back to details			
9/19/2014 2:08:10	marcellaweiss1		quizcram	2	3	5		5	7	4	6	7	6	7	7	I liked that the questions for each video segment were displayed before the video played. It made it easy to focus on specific information, and therefore learn it better (than information that was not asked about).  	A few of the questions seemed to be a tiny bit ambiguous based on the information that was provided before each question was asked.							
9/19/2014 10:48:55	dionnejackson		invideo	2	5	4		4	3	3	6	7	6	5	6	It was simple and easy to use. It paused the video itself and picked up from where it left off seamlessly.	I didn't dislike anything about the video viewing tool.				N/A.			
9/19/2014 12:10:16	johnnyxu		quizcram	2	2	5		3	4	2	5	5	4	5	2	It forced me to think about what I just saw. Processing this information allowed me to better memorize the facts presented in the video.	It was often redundant and can easily be manipulated so that you can skip it without penalty.   I couldn't see this having practical use for more theoretical courses where plain memorization of the material is not as important as it is for sciences.				This could end up being useful for more difficult classes as it can tell you if you missed bits of information.  It could also be misused as a justification for not watching a video because I sometimes did the questions first and if I got them right, I skipped the video. 			
9/19/2014 14:02:28	jiawenli		quizcram	1	4	5		7	6	6	6	7	7	7	3	I like that it's split to different parts, each corresponding to a question.	I can't adjust the speed.							
9/19/2014 22:26:53	annereynolds		invideo	1	4	5		3	5	7	7	7	5	2	6	The ability to speed up the lectures, the captions, the visual aids about what the professor was talking about. 	My internet is pretty good, and the video kept freezing. Also, the exactness of the subtitles (normally a good thing) was annoying. It would be less distracting if the subtitles removed any stutters/when the professor repeats words. 							
9/19/2014 22:48:35	lorant		invideo	2	4	4		5	6	7	6	7	7	7	7	Easy to use, immediate reinforcement of the material from the lecture.	The text sometimes covered part of the picture or the drawing in the first video.							
9/20/2014 4:05:23	dinianapiekutowski		quizcram	1	1	5		5	5	7	6	7	7	6	4	I like the combination of the questions and video -- it's so much better than having lecture and clicker questions as I've been accustomed to in introductory courses here. And it's also better than reading and reviewing material in my mind because it's consistent, I'm a visual person so I really enjoy learning through videos, and I can check my answers quickly. 	Part 2 and 4 glitched and I wasn't able to continue or replay.  Also I think it would also be helpful to highlight the correct answers instead of having them in a subtle grey if you've answered incorrectly. I didn't notice them at first when I got the first question incorrect and it took me a while to realize that breathing was a voluntary action so I wasted some time there...							
9/20/2014 9:40:44	emilytruong		quizcram	1	2	6		2	1	4	3	7	2	6	1	I liked how the questions were paced to the video.	I disliked how it showed how much percentage of the video I watched. Not only was it distracting, but I really don't see the point in that. Also, it's not very accurate because I heard almost all of the video but the video said that I only watched so and so percent of the video.

They were a nice summary, even if I did get them wrong occasionally.	Being able to make the video full screen would be nice!

9/20/2014 13:40:20	michelleloya		invideo	1	2	7		7	3	7	7	7	7	7	7	It was interactive, allowing me to stay focused throughout the video. The section were also very neat.	Each section had the introduction music. It was horrible but not intolerable when watching all the sections in a row.				Overall, it was a really good learning experience. I would honestly love using it and making it an integral part of my studying.

9/21/2014 4:08:12	ngocbui		quizcram	1	2	7		7	7	7	7	7	7	7	6	I liked that it picked out the key information I should retain by asking me questions. It helped me decide what to focus on as I watched the video. The chunks were very manageable as well. I liked how it was broken up.	A few of the questions were phrased in a confusing way. I also did not like that it gave me the answer after I got it wrong. This took away my opportunity to correct my own misunderstanding. Lastly, I would have liked more guided questions throughout the video. 				Overall a good experience.

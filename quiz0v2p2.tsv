9/19/2014 11:31:50	angelicachavez	disease of the cns, it affects the spinal cord and voluntary muscle movement	Travel the longest distance control muscle movement		It is more difficult to have toxins and viruses in the cns because it is difficult to permeate the brain barrier.	disease that affects the nerves and can cause paralysis 	post mitotic cells cannot regenerate.  neurons are post mitotic, we are born with a number and neurons and cannot replicate (create more)	can originate elsewhere and spread to the brain Take up space and cause pressure
9/19/2014 21:24:50	minh1	demyelination of axons in central nervous system causes nerve impulses to slow down or go missing	part of peripheral nervous system responsible for activating muscles can be damaged by viruses	disease caused by virus that damages sensory neurons symptom is that you cannot feel pain damage is located in peripheral nervous system	peripheral nervous system more vulnerable to toxins and viruses but also more capable of self repair	disease that damages motor neurons symptom is paralysis caused by polio virus polio vaccine exists	neurons are post-mitotic cells; cannot divide, so once it dies it's gone	tumor consistss of uncontrolled reproduction of cells spreads around ("metastize") through blood stream causes damage by increasing pressure in cranial cavity due to abnormal growth tumor cannot affect neurons since they are post-mitotic, but can affect glial cells
9/19/2014 22:50:41	nathanjones1	Central nervous system, a kind of disorder.	There are not very many of them total, they control movement		Peripheral is less vulnerable to toxins and viruses than the central nervous system and the peripheral is more able to repair it self than the central nervous system.			
9/20/2014 1:28:19	angilewis1	PNS effected by MS, which is erosion of myelin sheaths that are needed for successful transfer of information	information travels quickly in healthy individuals nervous system disorders prevent information flow susceptible to toxins 	effects PNS rare disorder cannot detect temperatures	PNS can repair itself, CNS cannot PNS more vulnerable to toxins, CNS has layers of protection	virus attacks CNS no cure progressively worsening symptoms	cell that has no divisions remaining, when it dies there is no copy or division left behind. Neuron is this type	not from neurons maybe from galil cells can begin somewhere else super dangerous since no room for skull to expand to accommodate growth
9/20/2014 1:30:18	marcellaweiss1	MS is a condition in which demylenation occurs, so messages take a long time or are improperly transcribed from the brain to the body. The central nervous system is affected by it.		often accompanied by inability to sweat, ??	??	??	neurons are post-mitotic, this means that it doesn't divide/multiply. once it dies, it's gone	creates intercranial pressure
9/20/2014 2:23:28	sakshisundaram1	Multiple sclerosis is when for some reason myelin sheet is not there on axon (?) It is causes two things(?) that's why called multiple sclerosis  Peripheral Nervous System is effected by it	1.) These neurons help us move and are present in cerebellum, medula oblongata and spinal cord but not forebrain 2.) There are only 100 or so motoneurons 3.) If they die, that part of body gets affected and most likely cannot be moved.	1.) A gene defect due to which people can't feel pain 2.) Such people also don't sweat as well 3.) ?	PNS 1.) highly vulnerable to toxins and viruses 2.) can repair themselves quickly  CNS 1.) protected by 3 layers of meninges hence vulnerable to virus only in specific conditions (when polio virus crosses meninges) not otherwise 2.) if damaged then no repair is possible	1.) affects motor neurons and hence mobility of the affected person 2.) the polio virus cleverly hides in the synaptic spaces and goes along the dendrite to cross the 3 layers of meninges into the brain 3.) affects the CNS the most 4.) spreads from contaminated food* *(my g.k, can't remember the video part but don't want to leave this point empty either) 	( This useful information was flashing behind the professor's head in the 2nd study tool so I couldn't concentrate upon it then and hence, now also I am having a tough time recalling it :/ )  These are formed after mitotic division in cells and are ageless/timeless (?) Post-mitotic cells are found in pitutary and pineal glands (?) 	1.) brain tumors are cells which go on dividing endlessly due to some unknown reason 2.)builds up pressure from inside the skull due to lack of space inside it 3.) usually spread from kidney and colon and reach to brain 4.) pineal and pitutiary glands are susceptible to forming brain tumors inside the head
9/20/2014 13:41:43	johnnyxu	MS occurs when neurons aren't able to transfer signals at the pace and rhythm at its original pace. The CNS is affected.	Can't remember.	it often goes hand-in-hand with another thing that isn't logically connected but actually is because both are controlled by the CNS.	CNS is able to repair itself and is much more vulnerable to toxins. The PNS is less vulnerable to diseases and cannot repair itself.	Polio is a viral disease. It attacks the CNS and goes through neurons through the barrier thing between CNS and PNS into the PNS. It causes paralysis.	No longer develops. Once its there, its there until it dies.	Cannot be caused by neurons because they are post-mitotic whereas is can be caused by glial cells because they reproduce. Brain turmors take up space in the cranium and increases pressure making it very dangerous.
9/20/2014 14:42:05	jiawenli	A disease that damages the central nervous system. The brain and spinal cord are affected.	They are found in brain stem and spinal cord There are relatively few motoneurons They controls muscles	Th signal is sent but not perceived due to the disruption of the communication between neurons	CNS is more fragile			They are like regular cells except they don't die
9/20/2014 23:34:52	lorant	A neural disease. The motor functions.	Make possible voluntary and involuntary movements. Few cells (about 100,000) are motoneurons. If connections to motoneurons are broken different body parts (movements) will be disabled.	Dendrites are broken or damaged and can not transfer pain information to the neurons.  	The central nervous system is more protected, therefore less vulnerable to toxins and viruses, but can not repair itself. The peripheral nervous system is more vulnerable, but it can repair itself.	Central nervous system disease. Caused by loss of motoneuron function. Cause by a virus. Mostly eradicated in developed countries. 		Tumors are rapidly growing and dividing by taking over the host cell. Neurons can not have brain tumors (no new neurons are made). Glial cells can have tumors. Tumors can spread to other parts or organs of the body. 
9/21/2014 0:51:05	annereynolds	Multiple sclerosis is when people can't move their muscles. Neurons are affected by it. Can affect only half the body (or was that just shingles--ex. only half of the lady's face was affected).	1. The neurons used for maintaining balance have to travel really fast  2. coated in Myolin (spelling)  3. neurons which help us move our muscles (ex arms and legs)	1. Often also tied to not being able to sweat  2. Occurs when neurons tied to feeling die.  3. don't remember 	Central: Much less vulnerable to toxins and viruses (because of the protecting wall) unless virus goes through the gap in the wall inside the neuron. Unable to repair themselves   Peripheral: Able to repair itself. Vulnerable to toxins and viruses	1. virus  2. Can only affect half of body? 3. tied to neurons 4. don't remember 	A post-mitotic cell will no longer replicate. An example is a neuron. 	1. Dangerous because the skull does not expand so tumors can put a lot of pressure on the skull   2. Can occur in two glands in brain  3.Can occur in cells in brain that start with a g  4. Can't occur in neurons 
9/21/2014 9:15:48	emilytruong	It's a demyelination disease, which causes loss of motor control. The forebrain?	as opposed to sensory neurons, they convey impulses to move the body pass through the pia and dura membranes synapses with other neurons	waz dat? --> completely guessing:   babies are born with it sensory neurons don't convey messages to the brain sensory neurons might be damaged or even destroyed	CNS: more vulnerable to toxins PNS: easier to repair themselves than the CNS & more vulnerable to viruses	results in loss of motor neurons causes lack of control in movement caused by a virus there's a vaccine for it	a cell that doesn't go through mitosis and the cell cycle anymore neuron	cause excess pressure inside the brain aren't caused by neurons can be caused by glial cells difficult to treat
9/21/2014 10:55:52	dinianapiekutowski	Multiple sclerosis is a disease caused by damage to the central nervous system.	motoneurons are those neurons involved in the sensation of touch. They are housed in the brain stem and can extend for meters in length.	Interestingly, this phenomenon prevents one from being sensitive to touch. It's caused by damage to the central nervous system.	The peripheral nervous system is much more susceptible to toxins than the central nervous system. This is because it does not have the protective barrier of the melangies as the CNS does. While this is the case, that doesn't mean the CNS is impermeable to damage from toxins and viruses because they can be damaged through entry from the PNS as in the case of polio. 	Polio damages the peripheral nervous system and enters the central nervous system through the axon. It then damages the cell body of the neuron. People suffering from polio exhibit paralysis. 	A post mitotic cell has stopped dividing. An example is the neuron.	Brain tumors are caused by increased pressure within the brain. This can be due to the division of glial cells, or cells in the pituitary or pineal gland. 
9/21/2014 15:10:56	dorondorfman	Don't remember (it was in the second movie which was far less clear to me)	Are located in the lower half of the brain In charge of the abstract functions moves in the neurons	It's a condition where people don't feel pain Caused by not having motoneurons that cannot deliver information to other cells.  	The central can repair itself while the peripheral cannot The central is less vulnerable than the peripheral	Don't remember	Don't remember	Don't remember
9/21/2014 15:54:57	yanyan	MS is when the mylin sheath becomes compromised	They control movement in the body and can be damaged but reparied.	This is dangerous because the brain is not receiving the signals that it needs	The central nervous system is less vulnerable but also less able to repair itself, while the opposite it true for the peripheral systems	It is now almost completely eradicated in developed countries.		They occur in the brain and mess with nervous functions
9/21/2014 15:58:40	celinajackson	Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system	1. Motoneurons send signals from the brain to our muscles that allow us to move 2. Motoneurons are found in the spinal column and the lower part of the brain		The peripheral nervous system is more vulnerable to toxins and viruses but has an improved ability to repair itself			1. They usually occur because a cell that is supposed to be growing/multiplying in another part of the body has gotten into the brain and is not multiplying in the wrong place 2. They inhibit brain functioning
9/21/2014 16:26:51	crystalromero	It is a demyelinating disease that inhibits movement in the body. It affects the Central Nervous system.	Located in the Central Nervous system. 	affects the sensory nervous system a person with congenital insensitivity to pain does not feel pain at "normal" levels a person with congenital insensitivity to pain does not sweat.	1) the peripheral nervous system is much more vulnerable to toxins 2) the peripheral nervous system also has a much higher ability to repair itself.	Polio is a virus Travels through the body in motoneurons can pass meninges	Post-mitotic cell means that the cell no long can replicate. Post-mitotic cell found in the brain is an axon.	Brain tumors can come from other parts of the body that have tumors and  cells undergoing metastasis (such as the liver or the stomach or the lungs) Brain tumors are dangerous because they create so much pressure in the brain due to the increase of fluid in the brain
9/21/2014 17:13:34	michelleloya	It inhibits motor skills. It directly affects neurons.	Found in spine.	Caused by damage to peripheral nervous system.	Viruses are small enough to attack both central and peripheral; toxins are large and can only attack peripheral. Central cannot not repair itself, but peripheral can.	Is a viral disease. It affects the central nervous system. Lessons motor capabilities.	A post-mitotic cell can no longer divide. A neuron is a post-mitotic cell.	They are not caused by the uncontrollable growth of neurons. They are often caused by the uncontrollable growth of glial cells. Can raise pressure in the brain. 
9/22/2014 7:00:25	ngocbui	It is the demyelination of the Central nervous system. This results in slower signals and messed up signals. 	They allow for movement.  They are the only neurons that leave the brain.  They can be found in brain stem or spinal cord.	A result of a myelin problem.  Peripheral nervous system is not functioning as it should.  Signals are not being transmitted accurately -- the spikes are not timed correctly. 	PNS is more hospitable to repairs and more susceptible to toxins and viruses. The meninges provides a safety barrier between the PNS and CNS thus making the CNS harder to access.  	It causes paralysis.  It is a viral disease. It affects the PNS. It destroys the motor neurons.	These are cells that can't divide any longer. Neurons are post-mitotic but glial cells are not. 	Problematic because they increase pressure.  Are caused from the metastasis of cancerous cells originating outside the brain.  Never caused from neurons because they are post mitotic Can be caused by cancerous glial cells.
9/22/2014 8:12:50	jonathangriffin	I can't remember what it is, but I think it effects PNS	Can't remember anything about the moroneurons	Another symptom is no sweating (Can't remember another fact)	PNS: more vulnerable to toxins and viruses/ better at repairing themselves	virus reduces ability of movement	One that cannot divide into more cells. Glandular	Glandular cells can cause brain tumors Glial Cells can cause brain tumors Causes less space in skull Tumors from other parts of the body can move into the brain
9/22/2014 11:38:54	sarahsimmons	MS is a chronic and degenerative nervous system disease. The glial cells are affected.	they are a type of neuron they let people move  they can be very long	you can't feel pain people with cipa can be more reckless b/c they don't get pain as a negative feedback when they do risky things they have to check themselves for injuries and such	the peripheral nervous system is more vulnerable to toxins and viruses the perpipheral nervous system is better at repairing itself even though it is very slow	it is a virus jonas salk invented the vaccine there are three types it causes paralysis and other bad things	it is a cell that has already undergone mitosis some neurons in the brain have already undergone mitosis	they are bad because they take up space they can kill you their severity depends on size, location, and type some are inoperable
9/22/2014 11:40:41	sydneyosifeso	disease that disables central nervous system	carry signals from spinal cord to muscles produce movement	person cannot feel physical pain 	the peripheral nervous system is more vulnerable to toxins and viruses but more able to repair itself	virus can lead to paralysis no cure prevented by vaccination	a cell that can no longer undergo mitosis differentiated neuron	abnormal cell growth in brain can be malignant or benign dangerous because of pressure created can cause seizures and headaches

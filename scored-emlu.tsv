The CNS is affected.	Can't remember.	it often goes hand-in-hand with another thing that isn't logically connected but actually is because both are controlled by the CNS.	CNS is able to repair itself and is much more vulnerable to toxins. The PNS is less vulnerable to diseases and cannot repair itself.	Polio is a viral disease. It attacks the CNS and goes through neurons through the barrier thing between CNS and PNS into the PNS. It causes paralysis.	No longer develops. Once its there, its there until it dies.

DNPL	thinking, problem solving	brain stem	prefrontal cortex	Millions!	The cell body houses the nucleus and the DNA and produces energy.	Dendrites extend from the cell body in a fractal like pattern, in clusters called arbors. They also receive information from the axons of other neurons. 	Axons can be tremendously long. They transfer information to the dendrites of other cells-- and the speed of information transfer depends on whether they are mylenated or 'naked' (unmylenated). 	The glial cells, far in number as they are, nurture the neurons. They guide the neurons to their proper location in their early stages and support them during course of their lives. A potential 'function', if you will, for a glial cell is to be the source of a brain tumor because glial cells unlike neurons can continue to divide. 	The videos never mentioned that...	Multiple sclerosis is a disease caused by damage to the central nervous system.	motoneurons are those neurons involved in the sensation of touch. They are housed in the brain stem and can extend for meters in length.	Interestingly, this phenomenon prevents one from being sensitive to touch. It's caused by damage to the central nervous system.	The peripheral nervous system is much more susceptible to toxins than the central nervous system. This is because it does not have the protective barrier of the melangies as the CNS does. While this is the case, that doesn't mean the CNS is impermeable to damage from toxins and viruses because they can be damaged through entry from the PNS as in the case of polio. 	Polio damages the peripheral nervous system and enters the central nervous system through the axon. It then damages the cell body of the neuron. People suffering from polio exhibit paralysis. 	A post mitotic cell has stopped dividing. An example is the neuron.	Brain tumors are caused by increased pressure within the brain. This can be due to the division of glial cells, or cells in the pituitary or pineal gland.

MCHL	Glucose concentration regulation. Calcium concentration regulation. Heart rate. Digestion.	Cerebral cortex. Spine.	Front lobe?	There are more than several different types of neurons. Hundreds if not thousands.	The cell body contains DNA.  The cell body contains energy producing organelles.  The cell body contains the nucleus. The cell body resembles a city hall.	Dendrites function as receivers, collecting chemical and electrical signals.  Dendrites branch from the cell body.	Axons can extend very long distances.  Axons carries electric signals from one neuron to the receiving dendrite of another neuron (minding the synapse). Axons are can be wrapped in glial cells. 	Glial cells quicken the pace of information transfer. Glial cells work in conjunction to neurons. 	Astrocytes are glial cells. Astrocytes are part of the central nervous system. 	It inhibits motor skills. It directly affects neurons.	Found in spine.	Caused by damage to peripheral nervous system.	Viruses are small enough to attack both central and peripheral; toxins are large and can only attack peripheral. Central cannot not repair itself, but peripheral can.	Is a viral disease.

NGCB	Learning Emotions Motivation Creativity	Brain stem and spinal cord	The forebrain	There are millions	It contains the nucleus.  Location of cell body is how neurons are classified as being a part of the Central or peripheral nervous system. It contains the mitochondria. It is where proteins are made. 	They branch out and form dendrite trees.  Information is received by neuron through dendrites. 	There is only one per neuron.  It sends out information to synaptic terminals.  It can be myelinated or not. 	Clean up and recycle.  10 to 1 ratio of glial cells to neurons. Crucial for cell development because they form the scaffolding needed for proper transmission of signals. 	They are the workhorses They clean up They ensure that synapses are well formed. 	It is the demyelination of the Central nervous system. This results in slower signals and messed up signals. 	They allow for movement.  They are the only neurons that leave the brain.  They can be found in brain stem or spinal cord.	A result of a myelin problem.  Peripheral nervous system is not functioning as it should.  Signals are not being transmitted accurately -- the spikes are not timed correctly. 	PNS is more hospitable to repairs and more susceptible to toxins and viruses. The meninges provides a safety barrier between the PNS and CNS thus making the CNS harder to access.  	It causes paralysis.  It is a viral disease. It affects the PNS. It destroys the motor neurons.	These are cells that can't divide any longer. Neurons are post-mitotic but glial cells are not. 	Problematic because they increase pressure.  Are caused from the metastasis of cancerous cells originating outside the brain.  Never caused from neurons because they are post mitotic Can be caused by cancerous glial cells.

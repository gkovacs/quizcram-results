In neuron cell body is powerhouse of energy 3.) Dendrites collect information and give it to cell body 4.) Cell body transmits information through only one axon.	1.) They receive information from other body parts and give it to the cell body of the neuron. 2.) They appear as branches of a tree called dendrite-tree, since one cell body can have many dendrites.	1.) There is only one axon coming out of each cell body of a neuron 2.) The axons carry information from the cell body and dump it in synaptic spaces. 3.) It can be very long, up to 5 and half feet depending upon a person's height and starting from toe to back of the head. 	1.) They are helpers of axon and help keep the synaptic connection intact as they are very brittle. 2.) Glial cells carry new-born neurons to their places during the development 3.) They recycle the information dumped by axons in the synaptic spaces.	1.) They are one of the types of glial cells, others are oligocytes(?) and (?) 2.) They are the most commonly found glial cells 3.) Tumorous growth of astrocytes is known as astrocytosis (?)  (can't remember these points)

9/21/2014 10:48:02	thinking, problem solving	brain stem	dinianapiekutowski	prefrontal cortex	Millions!	The cell body houses the nucleus and the DNA and produces energy.	Dendrites extend from the cell body in a fractal like pattern, in clusters called arbors. They also receive information from the axons of other neurons. 	Axons can be tremendously long. They transfer information to the dendrites of other cells-- and the speed of information transfer depends on whether they are mylenated or 'naked' (unmylenated). 	The glial cells, far in number as they are, nurture the neurons. They guide the neurons to their proper location in their early stages and support them during course of their lives. A potential 'function', if you will, for a glial cell is to be the source of a brain tumor because glial cells unlike neurons can continue to divide. 	The videos never mentioned that...

Millions of different types of neurons	Maintains homeostasis in the axon Sends the action potential across the axon terminal. 	They receive the signals from the axon synapses and send them to the cell bodies.	Can be as long as the length of one's body (almost) Transmits signals through action potentials There are millions of different types of axons, since each is specialized for a different function.	They assist the axons by supporting them and connecting them they make myelin they surpass the number of axons by far. 	They outnumber the other glial cells by far (most prevalent) They connect axons together and hold them so the dendrites still receive the dendritic signal

There are more than several different types of neurons. Hundreds if not thousands.	The cell body contains DNA.  The cell body contains energy producing organelles.  The cell body contains the nucleus. The cell body resembles a city hall.	Dendrites function as receivers, collecting chemical and electrical signals.  Dendrites branch from the cell body.	Axons can extend very long distances.  Axons carries electric signals from one neuron to the receiving dendrite of another neuron (minding the synapse). Axons are can be wrapped in glial cells. 	Glial cells quicken the pace of information transfer. Glial cells work in conjunction to neurons. 	Astrocytes are glial cells. Astrocytes are part of the central nervous system.

Location of cell body is how neurons are classified as being a part of the Central or peripheral nervous system. It contains the mitochondria. It is where proteins are made. 	They branch out and form dendrite trees.  Information is received by neuron through dendrites. 	There is only one per neuron.  It sends out information to synaptic terminals.  It can be myelinated or not. 	Clean up and recycle.  10 to 1 ratio of glial cells to neurons. Crucial for cell development because they form the scaffolding needed for proper transmission of signals. 	They are the workhorses They clean up They ensure that synapses are well formed.
